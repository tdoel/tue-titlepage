%\usepackage{siunitx}

You can print units in a sentence
like so: \SI{0.5}{m}. This is also
allowed in math mode:
$l = \SI{0.5}{m}$.

There is also support for scientific
notations, such that you can say that
the solar mass equals \SI{2e30}{kg}.

Inverted units are also possible:
\SI{5}{s^{-1}} or, maybe, for
better readability, using the
the other way of inputting units:
\SI{5}{\per\second}.
